Here all the server-side modules must be stored.
## Structure:
Branches: for now it is **develop -> master**. At this point push everything from your feature branches to [**develop**](https://github.com/HireHawk/hirehawk_server/tree/develop).<br/>
Later you can use [this guide](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/).
The **source** folder is where you should commit your projects.<br/>
To keep some conventional naming, let's keep each service in **X_service** folder, where X should be replaced with the name of the service. Services in this meaning are all things that provide API.<br/>
Other modules can be either stored in **X_module** folder or whatever name that you think is appropriate to describe the functionality.
