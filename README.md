Here all the server-side modules must be stored.
##Structure:
Branches: for now it is **develop -> master**. At this point push everything from your feature branches to **develop**.
The **source** folder is where you should commit your projects.
To keep some conventional naming, let's keep each service in **X_service** folder, where X should be replaced with the name of the service. Services in this meaning are all things that provide API.
Other modules can be either stored in **X_module** folder or whatever name that you think is appropriate to describe the functionality.
