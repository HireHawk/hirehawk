# hirehawk_server
This is the development branch, here you can commit everything whenever you like.<br>
All of the services/modules must be stored in the **source** folder.<br/>
To keep some conventional naming, let's keep each service in **X_service** folder, where X should be replaced with the name of the service. Services in this meaning are all things that provide API.<br/>
Other modules can be either stored in **X_module** folder or whatever name that you think is appropriate to describe the functionality.<br/>
